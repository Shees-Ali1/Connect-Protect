Last Updated: June 2024

	•	No Professional Advice
	•	As a peer supporter with Connect & Protect, you provide support based on your personal experiences and training. This support is not a substitute for professional medical, psychological, or legal advice. First responders seeking support should be advised to consult with licensed professionals for any medical, psychological, or legal issues.
	•	No Medical or Emergency Services
	•	Connect & Protect does not provide medical, psychological, or emergency services. Peer support is not intended to replace professional care or emergency services. In the event of a medical or psychological crisis, first responders should be directed to appropriate emergency services immediately.
	•	24/7 Anonymous Support
	•	Connect & Protect offers 24/7 anonymous support, which includes AI-assisted responses. Please note that these AI responses are considered part of the support process but do not guarantee a human response. Users should not rely solely on AI responses for critical or emergency situations.
	•	Tool for Peer Support Teams
	•	Connect & Protect is designed as a tool to assist peer support teams within their organizations. It is not intended to be the sole solution for mental health emergencies or ongoing professional mental health care.
	•	User Responsibility
	•	Users of Connect & Protect are responsible for their own health and well-being. While the app provides tools for support, users must exercise their own judgment in utilizing the app’s features and resources. Peer supporters should remind users to consult with licensed professionals when necessary.
	•	Confidentiality and Privacy
	•	Maintaining confidentiality is crucial; however, absolute confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. Peer supporters must comply with mandatory reporting laws, including disclosures of intent to harm oneself or others, or any indication of child or elder abuse.
	•	Emotional and Psychological Risks
